# grantprops

This is a website I made for a local property management company per their design, circa 2019.  It's built for Umbraco, a nifty CMS for .Net (way more fun to work with than Wordpress).  No private information is in the repo.

The Properties page is the most C# and Javascript heavy.  It's not *amazing* looking back on it (2022) code-wise, but hey - it *works*.

*HTML, CSS, Bootstrap 4, C#*
